#Vogon personal finance tracker

Simple web-based personal finance tracker using 

* AngularJS on client-side
* Spring MVC on server-side for AngularJS request handling
* JSP for page generation (single page with all data being retrieved with JSON calls)
* JPA and Spring Repositories for entity management
* H2 database for data storage, or a server-provided PostgreSQL (OpenShift/Heroku)

Named after the Vogons (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon) race who were known to be extremely boring accountants.

If all works well, the server should auto-redirect to HTTPS, however it's tricky and may not always work - some cloud environments require non-standard ports and/or unencrypted HTTP connections. Double-check that your deployment is redirecting to HTTPS by default!

2.0 and earlier versions also include a standalone version using Java FX for UI. This version is no longer maintained and may be completely removed in future releases. Requires Java 8 to run.

This project has a rich history of UI rewrites, including versions using

* [SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) 
* [Swing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29)
* [Java FX](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html)
